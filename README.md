## Overview
The idea for this web application came from a conversation with two former
co-workers. Our developers are distributed between the home office and various
clients across New York City. Other than quarterly meetings, it can be rare to
see co-workers and share experiences. This app attempts to help that situation
by scheduling lunches with random co-workers at various locations that are
convenient to both people.
